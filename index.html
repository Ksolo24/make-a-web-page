  <div class="Lesson 1">
    <h1>Basics of the Web</h1>
    <b>The Web</b>
    <p>The www(World Wide Web) is a collection of HTML documents, with over 30 billion pages in total. HTML documents are made up of something called HTML(Hypertext Mark up Language), a language that web browsers can read  & compose them into visible or audible web pages. HTML documents are made up of tags and elements, browsers do not display the HTML tags and scripts, but use them to interpret the content of the page.</p>
    <b>How a Web Page Works</b>
    <p>When a user wants to access a web page he runs a browser(for example, Google Chrome)  to display HTML documents found on the web, through the internet which connects it to the server.The internet is the world's largest computer network & a server is a computer that host the HTML files that make up the web page. The internet does this by following a set of rules called HTTP, a protocol of the web. </p>

    <h1>Creating a Structured Document</h1>
    <p><b>HTML & CSS</b></p>
    <br>- HTML and CSS are both languages.<br>- HTML controls the "structure" of a webpage.
    <br>- CSS controls the "style" of a page (how it looks).
    <br>- When programmers talk about the "DOM"(Document Object Model) they are talking about the "tree-like" structure of a page.
    <p><b>HTML</b></p>
    <br>HTML language = syntax + rules.
    <br>- Written in a document just like regular text but instead of text, you follow HTML syntax and rules.
    <br>- The browser turns HTML tags into elements that form a tre, it knows how to dot hat beacuase of the DOM.
    <p><b>DOM</b></p>
    <br>- Standard convention for representing and interactive with the elements in the HTML.
    <br>- Each HTML tag creates a element in the DOM that the browser uses to display the page.
    <p><b>CSS</b></p>
    <br>- Styling the page.
    <br>- The HTML document can provide the browser with information on what style to use and where to get it.
    <p> In creating a structured document you can use Scratchpad, Codepen or Sublime. These are some applications you can use upon creating a HTML/CSS document.

  <div class="Lesson 3">
    <h1>Adding CSS Style</h1>
    <p><b>How to include CSS styling in a webpage.</b></p>
    <br>1.) Write CSS in the <b>Head</b> element of your HTML.
    <br>2.) Link your HTML to a separate CSS file.
    <br>-This is done by writing your HTML and CSS in a separate file. Add a <b>Link</b> tag inside the <b>Head</b> element.
    <br>3.) Write your style inline with your HTML.
    <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets and they give programmers a way to control the style of related HTML elements.</p>
